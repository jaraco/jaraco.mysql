Status and License
------------------

``jaraco.mysql`` implements an alternative compatible interface
as the _mysql module in `mysql-python
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python>`_. The purpose
is to provide a pure-python distribution of mysql-python, i.e.
that requires no compiler.

``jaraco.mysql`` is written by Jason R. Coombs.  It is licensed under an
`MIT-style permissive license
<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.

You can install it with ``easy_install jaraco.mysql``, or from the
`subversion repository
<https://svn.jaraco.com/jaraco/python/jaraco.mysql#egg=jaraco.mysql-dev>`_ with
``easy_install jaraco.mysql==dev``.

This package currently has no official releases, as it currently
is still not a suitable replacement due to failing unittests.

Usage
-----

First, download the `latest patch for mysql-python
<http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/54081/jaraco-mysql-integration.5.patch>`_.

Apply that to the `1.2 branch of mysql-python
<http://mysql-python.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mysql-python>`_.

Install mysql-python without the extension using
``MySQLdb/setup.py --use-jaraco-mysql install``.  This will install
``mysql-python`` as ``mysqldb-jaraco``.  If you have both libraries
installed, they will conflict and mysql-python will use the first
one it finds in the path.  Consider using `virtualenv
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ to create an isolated
environment if you are testing.

Currently, you also have to make sure the official
MySQL 5.x library is in your path.
