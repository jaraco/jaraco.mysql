Status and License
------------------

``jaraco.mysql`` implements an alternative compatible interface
as the _mysql module in `mysql-python
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python>`_. The purpose
is to provide a pure-python distribution of mysql-python, i.e.
that requires no compiler.

``jaraco.mysql`` is written by Jason R. Coombs.  It is licensed under an
`MIT-style permissive license
<http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php>`_.

You can install it with ``easy_install jaraco.mysql``, or from the
`subversion repository
<https://svn.jaraco.com/jaraco/python/jaraco.mysql#egg=jaraco.mysql-dev>`_ with
``easy_install jaraco.mysql==dev``.

Usage
-----

First, download the `latest patch for mysql-python
<https://svn.jaraco.com/jaraco/python/jaraco.mysql/patch/integration.patch>`_.

Apply that to the `1.2 branch of mysql-python
<http://mysql-python.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mysql-python/branches/MySQLdb-1.2>`_.

Install mysql-python without the extension using
``MySQLdb/setup.py --use-jaraco-mysql install``.  This will install
``mysql-python`` as ``mysqldb-jaraco``.  If you have both libraries
installed, they will conflict and mysql-python will use the first
one it finds in the path.  Consider using `virtualenv
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ to create an isolated
environment if you are testing.

You must have the MySQL 5.x client library installed on the system.

Changes
-------

1.1
~~~

* Implemented Python 3.x compatibility.  This package can now be installed
  on Python 3 without any problems.  Note, however, that this package is
  largely useless without mysql-python, which does not have Python 3.x
  compatibility yet.
* jaraco.mysql is now tested under Ubuntu Linux against MySQL 5.0 and
  passes all unit tests.

1.0
~~~

* Initial release; this first release passes all unit tests in
  MySQLdb/tests in a 32-bit Windows environment against MySQL 5.1. Some
  issues may still exist.
